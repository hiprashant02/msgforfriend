    1st Story:
I have a sister from Haryana. She's married now. She likes to enjoy her life, travel, and participate in household decisions. Let me tell you her story.

In her childhood, she was a good student. She used to get top 10 ranks in most of the exams. Later, she scored 89% in 10th grade and 85% in 12th grade. She wasn't an excellent student but she wasn't bad either. She had potential. Then she joined an ordinary college in Chandigarh. Even in college, her CGPA was 7, which is good. Then after a year of college, she got married. In the first month, my brother-in-law took her to Kerala and Tamil Nadu for a trip. After a few months, her household responsibilities increased and she became busy with household chores. Her life was okay, but now her decisions didn't matter, only her mother-in-law's decisions did. She didn't have much value in the house. Only my brother-in-law listened to her a little. After 2 years, she had a son and got even busier.

Can you understand what went wrong here? She spent 15 years in school and 4 years in college.but unhone apne life me mehnat kiya, yet she feels she couldn't achieve anything in her life. Her suggestions are not considered while making decisions in her husband's home. She couldn't travel to hill stations during college days because she belonged to a lower-middle-class family. She couldn't enjoy her days. <br><br>

Ye sab baat unhone mujhe bataya. Do you know why this happened? Because of these reasons:

<br>
<br>
1) She believed in the traditional education system. Her college had only about a 1% placement rate. The college didn't teach her any major skills according to industry standards, so she couldn't get any good-paying jobs.

<br>
<br>

2) Didi kabhi serious nahi hui future ko leke. Wo bas aage badhti gayi, courses complete karte gayi. Serious hona matlab padhai karna hi nahi hota. It's more about learning skills and being productive.

<br>
<br>

3) Unawareness: Government ne bohot schemes launch kiya hain girls ke liye like jisme graduated girls ko 50 lakh ka loan diya jayega and usme se 15 lakh maaf kar diya jayega (like subsidy) and borrower has to pay only 35 lakh, with interest on only 50% of the amount. But ye loan only business ke liye diya jayega so girls should learn about business first. Isn't it an interesting offer? Yes. Our government favors girls. They make laws in favor of girls. So girls can use those laws to make their life better. But meri didi utna aware nahi thi aur koi guidance bhi nahi tha.

2nd Story:
Meanwhile, my Delhi sister's life was similar, but she focused on learning graphic designing in the first year of college. She learned public speaking, photography, and how to talk in business terms. In the second year of college, she started earning 20-25k monthly from freelancing. She started traveling. She explored many states, apna fav chizen khaati thi, and life achhe se enjoy kari. A few months before the end of college, she got a job in Gurgaon with a 68k monthly salary. She traveled a lot in the next 2 years, enjoyed a lot, and gained the power to make her own decisions. In those 2 years, she compounded her savings, increased their value, and by the end of the year, she purchased a house and a scooty. Apna ghar ka 100% kharcha didi hi karne lagi (bcoz unka bhai chhota tha). Fir unka marriage ho gya and didi apne husband ke Ghar me decision making me participate karti hai. Unka value hota hai. Wo abhi bhi thik thak apna life enjoy kar paa Rahi hai.

I hope you can see the difference between these two stories and understand why the difference occurred. After marriage, you will have to take responsibilities, and you should. The family system should not be broken. But that doesn't mean you should forget to live life properly. Tumhara self-esteem bohot kam hai compared to my class girls. You have potential. I know tum ek din apne parents ka naam aur bhi ucha karogi. But focus on improving your self-esteem.
<br>
<br>
Tumne kaha na ki tumhe ghumne ko nahi milega? You know what, you will say the same words in 2027 because agar tum change nahi hui toh tum bhi apna life ka best nahi jee paogi. Tum aise hi reh jaogi. But you can bro, you have potential. Tum raat ko late se jagna band kar do. Dark circles tum jaisi pretty ladkiyon pe achha nahi lagta.
<br>
<br>
Aur agar tumhare us cousin ko ana hoga toh wo aa jayega. Agar tum matter karti ho uske liye toh wo wapas tumse baat karega. Agar nahi karta hai toh leave it. Tum agar kisi insaan ke liye matter nahi karti toh tum uske liye kyon chinta karogi ki he doesn't care? If someone doesn't care about you then apna attitude bhi "I don't give a fuck" wala attitude rakho. Tbh you are one of the best girls in my life.
<br>
<br>
Tum thoda serious ho jao. Start focusing on the entrance exam of AMU. Aur apne har din ka 2 hours kisi topic/skills sikhne me time do. If you don't know what to learn or kahan se sikhun toh ek baar bol ke dekhna. I'll try to find suitable answers. Tum agar daily 1-2 hours koi achha cheez me invest karogi toh tumhe internal motivation ayega (sunne me funny hai but you'll realize it once you start doing it). Agar tum ye baat samajh ke tum thoda productive ban jaogi toh tum next kuch years me financially strong and independent girl ban jaogi and ghar me decision lene ka bhi power aa jayega tumhare paas. Tum hill station travel karogi, ghumogi, apna mann pasand ka kha pi paogi and bohot achha life jiyogi and I promise main rahunga agar koi bhi dikkat ayega toh.
<br>  
<br>
       And bro if you are not interested in this right now ya fir you don't have energy for these things then it's okkay. baad me ispe focus karna but aisa nahi ki jab 60 saal ki burhiya ban jaogi tab focus karna. it's okay to take break and enjoy life. so yaa i'm not asking to focus on it presently, thoda rest lelo uske baad jab mann kare to focus on these things. but utna late bhi nahi karna.
